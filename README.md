# Etch-A-Sketch
Little etch a sketch program for DOM practice

Things I learned during this period:
JS only runs once, remember to make sure code is inside event listeners for it to be dynamic.

More practice with using event functions, used e.target to check where the mouse was pointing at

style.cssText is really useful.
